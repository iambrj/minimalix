Mega
===

Mega is a small text editor in less than 1M lines of code (counted with cloc) based on Kilo.

Usage: mega `<filename>`

Keys:

    CTRL-S: Save
    CTRL-Q: Quit
    CTRL-F: Find string in file (ESC to exit search, arrows to navigate)

Mega does not depend on any library (not even curses). It uses fairly standard
VT100 (and similar terminals) escape sequences.
